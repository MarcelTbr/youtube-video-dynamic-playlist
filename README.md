This is a non-commercial app.

It is conceived to work in a "request your song" fashion, allowing an admin to control the playback of the video sources (user= "admin" pass= "admin") and other users to login and interact with the playlist by adding videos to it, and voting their favorite songs. 

The most voted song will play automatically the next after the current one has reached the end. 

The top song resets to 0 votes after having been played completely. 

It's optimized for Chrome. Complete functionality is not granted on other browsers.
